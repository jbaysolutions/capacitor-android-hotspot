# FAQ

### Can I create a Hotspot with a specific name and shared key?

No. This is not supported by the Android system.

### When I connect to the Hotspot, I don't have access to the internet. What is wrong?

Nothing. Like it was stated on the first page of the Guide:

*The network created by this method **WILL NOT HAVE INTERNET ACCESS**. This is an Android limitation, or design decision.*
