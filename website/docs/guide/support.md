# Support

This project is OpenSource and maintained as needed by <a href="https://www.jbaysolutions.com">JBay Solutions</a>.

If you need this plugin to do more than it does, there are three options:

## Do it and submit PR

You do it yourself and if you would like to contribute back, submit a PR.

## Request the Feature

Send over a Request Feature issue using GitHub, and if it is inside the scope of this plugin, we can implement if for you. 

Keep in mind that we are busy, and to implement features we need to allocate someone, which costs money, time, etc. We do this on our free time and is dependent on the availability of a team member.

So, with this is mind, remember to provide as many details as possible of what you want, how you want it and context. 

Also, **BE AVAILABLE TO TEST IT**!
